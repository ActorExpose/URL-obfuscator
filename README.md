This tool uses public open redirects and http basic auth to make phishing attacks
difficult to detect. Includes Tor onion services which are vulnerable to open redirects too.

This Tool was originally developed to check effectiveness of Antiviruses and user education as defensive measures against obfuscated URLs.
